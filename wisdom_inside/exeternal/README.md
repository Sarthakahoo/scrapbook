#Stolen content inside this folder
None of the code inside this folder is my. Mostly I downloaded sources from free screncasts(or tutorials) or parts of opensource projects and put them here for better organizing and so I can find and work with them more easily.

If you have any questions about this or complains contact me on equivalent@eq8.eu
