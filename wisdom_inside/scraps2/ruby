## how to detect if column exist in Rails ActiveRecord

Columns are automaticly transformed into methods for instances of thot Model.
That mean you can do 

    event = Event.last
    event.respond_to?(:updated_at)
    # true

There may be an issues if you writing Rails engine because if model have method
with same name, it will return true even if column doesn't exist

So more acurate way is to ask like this:

     event = Event.last
     event['updated_at'].present?  # => true 

This is directly asking instance "what is the value of a column". 

If you don't want to trigger sql query to fetch the value of a column but you rather 
ask model class directly if the column exist you can do this:

     Event.column_names.include?('updated_at')
