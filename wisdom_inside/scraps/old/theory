h3. keywords:

* class-object       # Dave
* object             
* instance of object # a=Dave.new
* ghost object with singleton methods




notebook about theory 

* object oriented programing = you have *state and behavior* in one cluster => object
   founded by norway programers to define state and behavor of trucks in dockyard
* in all ruby ther is object class mechanism => Object points on the class that define its behavior
** if object cals method that counldnt be found in class, it look next to parrent class
*** string is class that has parrent class "object"
*** ghost classes, 
* *self* the current object
** default receiver == if there isn't specify any Something.method  ruby defaultly takes the current(self) obj
** instanc @variables are found
* defined methads are also in a class







h3. everithing in ruby is object, eaven classes 

<c>
Dave         #its not a class its a constant refrencing to something... ta a class
puts defined?(Dave)   #constant
Dave.class            #Class
</c>

...so Dave is a constant representing object of class








h3. everithing can return value, eaven definitions

<c>
somthing= class Dave
  #...
	99
end
puts something    
</c>

??99??
you can eaven return self









h3. self

<c>
puts "Before class definition, self=#{self}"
class Dave do
 # ...
puts "Inside class definition, self=#{self}"
end
puts "After class definition, self=#{self}"
</c>

??Before class definition, self=main
Before class definition, self=Dave
Before class definition, self=main??








h3. class naming

<c>
cls = Class.new
puts cls
Dave=cls
puts cls
</c>

??#<Class:0q8affc>
Dave??

class is just a object = don't need specific name, when I give it an constant to hadle, then the class will take that name for object name, but she doesn't need name for existance








h3. class methods don't exist,theyr are just an ilusion

<c>
class Dave
  def self.say_hello
	  puts "hi"
	end
end
</c>

self.say_hello looks like class metdod, but self is set to class object

<c>
animal="cat"
def animal.say_hello
 puts "miaow"
end 
</c>

so no such things as class methods doesn't exist, there are only singleton method that aro on class objects








h3. current class

its something like a pointer of stack to currently opened class
