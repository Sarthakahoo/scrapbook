## problem: 

    Could not find net-scp-1.0.6 in any of the sources

on Ubuntu 12.04 (Linux Mint 13), ruby ruby-2.0.0-rc2 + rvm, rails 3.2.12

## solution

    bundle update
    bundle install

## reason

This is probably caused by fog gem dependancy. Refering to [this discussion](https://github.com/fog/fog/pull/1562)  net-scp -v 1.0.6 was yanked from RubyGems.org

so doing just `gem install fog -v 1.0.6` wont do the trick
