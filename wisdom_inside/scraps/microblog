## print random number in formated string

### with with 4 char format

like:

    "90  "
    "590 "

"%4s" % rand(9999)
"%-4s" % rand(9999)
~~~


### with leading zeros 4 char format

~~~ruby
"%04d" % rand(9999)
~~~

    "0010"
    "0300"

## oweride instance method that is asigned to alredy existing method


content is  method dynamicly created from ActiveRecord on comment table of Comment instance (content is column in db of table comments)

    Comment.new(:content => "\naaa\r")

now I want to remove new line chars from the string. The fastest solution is like this: 

    class Comment
      def content
        raw_content = super
        raw_content.delete("\n\r")
      end
    end

now this isn't best practice solution. I should create new method like *dislpay_content*  and just call *content.delete* there but there are som temporary refactore situations where this works ok
