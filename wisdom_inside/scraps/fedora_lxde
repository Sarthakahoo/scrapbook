# prefix

currently I'm using fedora & lxde on my eee pc, so here are some hints


#suspend trought console

     sudo pm-suspend

# powermanager #

aGet gnome power manager from the repo's.
Open /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart as root, and add the line:
@gnome-power-manager (Make sure the file has a blank line as its last entry, and save.)
Close out and reboot. There should now be an accurate working battery monitor in your LXDE taskbar, with the added benefits of settings for stand-by and hibernation from Preferences.
