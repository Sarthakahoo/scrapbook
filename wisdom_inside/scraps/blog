# Working with SimpleForm collection_radio_buttons helper

date:2012-11-08

Today I needed to do collection of options for search form, but I didn't want the html include unnecessary stuff that SimpleForm gives, so I decided to use [recomended](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form#collection-radio-buttons) collection_radio_buttons helper.


note: I'm using this in combination with [Ransack](https://github.com/ernie/ransack), that's why the *q* parameter, ...oh and the syntax is HAML

    = simple_form_for @search, method: 'get', url: documents_path do |f|
      = f.collection_radio_buttons :latest_true, [[0, 'All'] ,[1, 'Latest only']], :first, :last, {collection_wrapper_tag: :div, collection_wrapper_class: 'latest_or_all_documents_radio', checked: (params['q'] ? params['q']['latest'] : 0)  }


[simple form reference for collection_radio_buttons helper](http://rubydoc.info/github/plataformatec/simple_form/master/SimpleForm/ActionViewExtensions/Builder#collection_radio_buttons-instance_method)
  
     (Object) collection_radio_buttons(attribute, collection, value_method, text_method, options = {}, html_options = {}) 


generated html: 

    <div class="latest_or_all_documents_radio">
      <span>
        <input id="q_latest_true_0" name="q[latest_true]" value="0" type="radio">
        <label class="collection_radio_buttons" for="q_latest_true_0">All</label>
      </span>
      <span>
        <input checked="checked" id="q_latest_true_1" name="q[latest_true]" value="1" type="radio">
        <label class="collection_radio_buttons" for="q_latest_true_1">Latest only</label>
      </span>
    </div>

# Factory girl causing rake db:migrate failure

I got this factory:

~~~ruby
# spec/factories/posts.rb 

FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :post do
    title   "My ultra cool post"
    content "Lorem ipsum"
    association :author, :factory => :user

    trait :owned_by_provider do
      some_other_description  'Foo'
      providers  [ FactoryGirl.create( :provider )]
    end
  end
end
~~~

...on migrated database it was working correctly, however on clean database (without migrations) throwing this error:

    rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
    rake aborted!
    Mysql2::Error: Table 'cool_project_developtent.providers' doesn't exist: SHOW FULL FIELDS FROM `providers`

The solution is to put association in *{}* lambda block so it won't get evaluated during rake initialization...


FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :post do
    title   "My ultra cool post"
    content "Lorem ipsum"
    association :author, :factory => :user

    trait :owned_by_provider do
      some_other_description  'Foo'
      providers {  [ FactoryGirl.create( :provider )] }
    end
  end
end

# passing CoffeeScript variable to ERB

in rails 3.1 and up, you can use CoffeeScript by default. 

*app/assets/javascript/my.coffee*

    foo = 123
    alert foo

you can also pass ERB variables to CoffeeScript files with by just extending file extension to .erb

*app/assets/javascript/my.coffee.erb*

    foo = <%= 120 + 3 %>
    alert foo

you can easily use Rails url helpers in your coffee script files by extending files with url helpers

*app/assets/javascript/my.coffee.erb*

    <% environment.context_class.instance_eval { include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers } %>
    foo = "<%= root_path %>
    alert foo

**note:** more info on this find it [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7451517/using-a-rails-helper-method-within-a-javascript-asset)

I was wondering, "is there way to pass CoffeeScript variable into ERB method ?" 
The answer is: no ...not directly

Let say you want to call member action on Documents controller with AJAX

you can do it this way 
   
*app/assets/javascript/my.coffee*

      document_id = 123
      $.ajax 'documents/' + document_id + '/my_member_action',
        type: 'get'
        dataType: 'json'
        data:
          foo: "foo"
          bar: "bar"
        success: (data) ->
          #..

but better idea is Rails way:

*app/assets/javascript/my.coffee.erb*

      <% environment.context_class.instance_eval { include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers } %>
      document_id = 123
      url = "<%= my_member_action_documents_path( id: "document_id") %>".replace(/document_id/, document_id)
      $.ajax url,
        type: 'get'
        dataType: 'json'
        data:
          foo: "foo"
          bar: "bar"
        success: (data) ->
          #..

I'll generate my  *my_member_action_documents_path* string with *id = "document_id"* ...

     documents/document_id/my_member_action

... and than I'll replace it with value inside CoffeeScript variable *document_id*

     documents/123/my_member_action


The main advantage of using Rails paths is your javascirpt assets is that when routes changes, many times developers forget to change JavaScript files. Many applications don't have tests on JavaScript, and so this way your code will blow up with NoMethodError












# Load factories properly 

I had one factory which was creating resource from another factory.

    FactoryGirl.define do
      factory :verification do
        verifier_id User.last || FactoryGirl.create(:user)
        verified_at Time.now
        item  FactoryGirl.create(document)
      end
    end


on verifier ( User resource) factory was created correctly but the item (Document resource) factory was throwing 

    Factory not registered: document (ArgumentError)

I was googling for a while and found [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8409787/factorygirl-factory-not-registered-user-argumenterror) post. Basically the solution is to do something like this in your spec/spec_helper.rb file

    require 'factory_girl_rails'
    FactoryGirl.factories.clear
    FactoryGirl.find_definitions











# RSpec on Rails callback presence

let say we have this model (e.g.: described in [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7361036/rspec2-testing-a-before-validation-method) StackOverflow question)

    class Part < ActiveRecord::Base
      before_validation :strip_whitespace

    protected
      def strip_whitespace
        self.title = self.title.strip
      end
    end

the proper way to write the spec is to separately write spec on **strip_whitespace** method and then just check if model class have callback set on it, like this: 

    describe Part do
      let(:record){ described_class.new }

      it{ described_class._validation_callbacks.select{|cb| cb.kind.eql?(:before)}.collect(&:filter).should include(:strip_whitespace) }

      #private methods
      describe :strip_whitespace do
        subject{record.send(:strip_whitespace)} # send() because calling private method
        before{ record.stub(:title).and_return('    foo    ')
        it "should strip white spaces" do
          subject.should eq 'foo'
          # or even shorter
          should eq 'foo'
        end
      end
    end

if you need to skip callback behavior in some scenarios use

   before{ Part.skip_callback(:validation, :before, :strip_whitespace)}
   before{ Part.set_callback( :validation, :before, :strip_whitespace)}

# Rails ActiveRecord good to know

## rails automatically converts integer to boolean on boolean type column

Let say we have model "Job" with boolean Active Record column "urgent"

      j = Job.new
      j.urgent        #nil

      J.urgent = true
      J.urgent        #true

      j.urgent = 0    
      J.urgent        #false

      j.urgent = 1
      J.urgent        #true


so rails is automatically converting them. Can be handy when migrating old non-rails database to new Ralis project... Good to know :) 


## Incorrect database datetime is converted to nil

Let say the database you're migrating has datetime columns by default set to "0000-00-00 00:00:00". This datetime is incorect because months are 0 month and 0 day. Rails won't let you set this and saves nil

    a = Job.new

    a = a.next_action_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
    a.next_action_at    # nil

As you might know Unix timpestamp is pointing to 1st of January 1970

    Time.at 0 #1970-01-01 01:00:00 +0100

so 

    a.next_action_at = '1970-01-01 00:00:00'
    a.next_action_at.to_i    # 0

and days before that

    a.next_action_at = '170-08-20 00:00:00'
    a.next_action_at.to_i    # -56782512000
    a.next_action_at         # Mon, 20 Aug 0170 00:00:00 UTC +00:00

Good to know :) 


#  undefined method `capture_haml' it helper specs with haml


it one helper I got 
  
~~~ruby
  def some_helper
    capture_haml do
      haml_concat 'foo'
    end
  end
~~~

and I keep getting RSpec error

     undefined method `capture_haml'

the reason is that haml isn't loaded in helper spec yet


~~~ruby 
require "spec_helper"

describe WidgetHelper do
  before :each do
    helper.extend Haml::Helpers
    init_haml_helpers
  end

  it 'should correctly run my helper with capture haml' do
    ...
  end
end
~~~

and you may also need to include haml helpers in rspec config

~~~ruby

  RSpec.configure do |config|
    # ...

    #haml helper
    config.include Haml::Helpers, :type => :helper

    # ...
  end
~~~





# RSpec stack level too deep error when mocking incorectly


have you ever run into this RSpec problem ?

       Failure/Error: Unable to find matching line from backtrace
       SystemStackError:
         stack level too deep

Thin error magically appears and disappear depending if you run *rspec spec* or *rspec spec/some_dir*, and it always works when I try to run rspec on one file causing this problem.
First it seems to me like RSpec bug and  took me while to figure what I was doing wrong.


~~~ruby
describe SomeModel do
  context 'when rss_url not parsable' do
    before{Feedzirra::Feed.should_receive(:fetch_and_parse).at_least(1).with(record.rss_url).and_return('')}
    it{record.errors_on(:rss_url).should include "Couldn't parse RSS url"}
  end
end
~~~

Do you see the problem ? (hint: ignore anything to do with Feedzira, concentrate on RSpec syntax)

### answer: 

I'm trying to stub **Feedzirra::Feed** in before statement (which I actually can do) is just I'm also checking **should_recive** which I is shouldn't do in **before** hook

so this will work properly

~~~ruby 

# should_receive in it statemet works
describe SomeModel do
  context 'when rss_url not parsable' do
    it do
      Feedzirra::Feed.should_receive(:fetch_and_parse).at_least(1).with(record.rss_url).and_return('')
      record.errors_on(:rss_url).should include "Couldn't parse RSS url"
    end
  end
end

~~~

so remember if you need to stub something in **before** block, never do it through should_receive, anything with word *"should"* belongs to it statement

~~~ruby
  # stubing works
  context 'when rss_url not parsable' do
    before{  Feedzirra::Feed.stub(:fetch_and_parse).with(record.rss_url).and_return('') }
    it{ record.errors_on(:rss_url).should include "Couldn't parse RSS url"}
  end
~~~

# rails delegate on polymorphic association


~~~ruby
class Address < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :addressable, :polymorphic => true
  attr_accessible :phone

  # address got column phone
end
~~~


~~~ruby
class Client < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :address, :as => :addressable
  delegate :phone, :to => :address, :prefix => true, :allow_nil => true
end
~~~


### before delegation (just polymorphic association)

    a = Client.new
    a.address
    #=>#<Address id: nil, ....
    a.address.phone
    #=> nil
    a.address_phone
    #NoMethodError: undefined method


### after delegation

    a = Client.new
    a.address
    #=>#<Address id: nil, ....
    a.address.phone
    #=> nil
    a.address_phone

# searching (greping) availible methods

ever had a problem in Rails that you wasn't sure if your instance/class have certain method? ...so you did :

~~~ruby
user.methods
~~~

and hundred methods rolled up?

recently my colleague showed me I can do 

~~~ruby
user.methods.grep /phone/
~~~

this also works with:

~~~ruby
User.methods.grep /first/
~~~





# passing hash to link to 

you can pass hash to link_to

~~~haml
  %li= link_to 'Export All', {:controller=>controller_name,:action=>'index', :format=>:xls, :all=>'true'}
~~~

     /users.xls?all=true


sometimes you want to render same params (e.g. export search resoult)

~~~haml
  %li= link_to('Export Page', params.merge({:format=>:xls, :controller => controller_name, :action => "index"}))
~~~

    /users.xls?q%5Bname_cont%5D=tom&q%5Bs%5D=email+asc

# regular expression on several lines

in ruby you can do several line regular expression, like this one by "ridgerunner" found on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5719353/how-do-i-fix-this-multiline-regular-expression-in-ruby)

~~~ruby
re = / # Match a MARKDOWN CODE section.
    (\r?\n)              # $1: CODE must be preceded by blank line
    (                    # $2: CODE contents
      (?:                # Group for multiple lines of code.
        (?:\r?\n)+       # Each line preceded by a newline,
        (?:[ ]{4}|\t).*  # and begins with four spaces or tab.
      )+                 # One or more CODE lines
      \r?\n              # CODE folowed by blank line.
    )                    # End $2: CODE contents
    (?=\r?\n)            # CODE folowed by blank line.
    /x
result = subject.gsub(re, '\1<pre>\2</pre>')
~~~

the thing is that at the end of expression ridgerunner is passing the "x" option 
    /.*/x         extended: ignore whitespace in pattern

[reference](http://www.ralfebert.de/blog/ruby/regex_cheat_sheet/)

However, if you need regular expression with full support for white spaces, you can do other kind of regular expression comments,

      /\d(?# my ultra evil comment
      )/

example form one helper I wrote

~~~ruby
html.should =~
 /^<div class='box'>\s*(?# box div open tag
   )<h4\s*class='box-header\s*round-top'>\s*(?# h4 open tag
     )<i\s*class='box-icon\s*ultra-cool'><\/i>\s*(?# box icon
     )foo Bar\s*(?# :title content 
     )<a\s*class='box-btn'\s*title='close'>\s*<i\s*class='icon-remove'><\/i>\s*<\/a>\s*(?#remove button
     )<a\s*class='box-btn'\s*title='toggle'>\s*<i\s*class='icon-minus'><\/i>\s*<\/a>\s*(?#minus button
   )<\/h4>\s*(?#  h4 close tag
   )<div class='box-container-toggle'>\s*(?# open div.box-container-toggle
     )<div\s*class='box-content'\s?>\s*(?# open div.box-content
       )#{text}\s*(?# # yield block
     )<\/div>\s*(?# close div.box-content
   )<\/div>\s*(?# close div.box-container-toggle
 )<\/div>$/

# rspec and haml helpers


today I was creating helper to handle bootstrap table:

~~~ruby
# a/h/table_helper.rb
#
module TableHelper
  def table
    capture_haml do
      haml_tag :table, :class=>['table', 'table.table-striped', 'table-bordered', 'table-condensed'] do
        yield
      end
    end
  end
end
~~~

no extra magic, but when I wanted to create rspec on it I keep on getting 

    undefined method `capture_haml' for #<#<Class:0x0000000364cf28>:0x00000003e32e40>

now I found few really descriptive solutions on this close to my problem that should work like 
http://2rg.tumblr.com/ (find "Including Haml Helpers in an RSpec spec" on site)

ruby~~~
# spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'rubygems'
require 'spork'

Spork.prefork do
  RSpec.configure do |config|
    #...

    #Helpers
    config.include Haml::Helpers , :type => :helper
    config.include ActionView::Helpers, :type => :helper
    config.before :each, :type => :helper do
      init_haml_helpers
    end

    #...
  end
end
~~~

(my colleague is using above one in similar project, from not too far ago and it's working)


from http://blog.wolfman.com/articles/2007/7/14/using-rspec-to-test-haml-helpers  :

~~~ruby
describe ApplicationHelper do
 
  before :each do
    helper.extend Haml
    helper.extend Haml::Helpers
    helper.send :init_haml_helpers
  end
  
  it do
    helper.table do 
     #...
    end
  end
end
~~~

but in this one I keep on getting 

     undefined local variable or method `init_haml_helpers'



short story short

~~~ruby
# spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'rubygems'
require 'spork'

Spork.prefork do
  RSpec.configure do |config|
    #...

    #Helpers
    config.include Haml::Helpers , :type => :helper

    #...
  end
end


# spec/helper/table_helper.rb
describe TableHelper do
 
  before :each do
    helper.extend Haml::Helpers
    init_haml_helpers
  end
  
  it do
    helper.table do 
     #...
    end
  end
end
~~~


...and this one  actually work for me.

I'm running ruby-1.9.3-p194 rspec-2.10.0 rails-3.2.6


























#@todo Rails flash partial trouble 

Today I found my colleague for dispalying flash messages: 

~~~ruby
- flash.each do |name, msg|
  %div{:class => "alert alert-#{name == :notice ? "success" : "error"}"}
    %a.close{"data-dismiss" => "alert"} ×
    = content_tag :div, msg, :id => "flash_#{name}" if msg.is_a?(String)
~~~

pretty simple, but we were using this same code in two layouts. So lets remove duplicity and move it to partial.

*app/views/layouts/application.html.haml*

~~~ruby
!!!
%html
  %head
  %body
    = render 'layouts/flash'
~~~

*app/views/layouts/admin.html.haml*

~~~ruby
!!!
%html
  %head
  %body
    = render 'layouts/flash'
~~~

*app/views/layouts/_flash.html.haml*

~~~ruby
- flash.each do |name, msg|
  %div{:class => "alert alert-#{name == :notice ? "success" : "error"}"}
    %a.close{"data-dismiss" => "alert"} ×
    = content_tag :div, msg, :id => "flash_#{name}" if msg.is_a?(String)
~~~

Everything looks nice and should work, but when we test it will get:

    ActionView::Template::Error (undefined method `each' for nil:NilClass)

hmm...

so maybe the locale variable is incorrectly passed, lets try this


~~~ruby
= render 'layouts/flash', :locales => {:flash => flash}
~~~

same error!

    ActionView::Template::Error (undefined method `each' for nil:NilClass)

After googling for a while I found this same problem on Stack Overflow: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8023396/rails-3-notice-and-error-flash-cannot-be-rendered-in-a-partial

The thing is that rails partial is initializing variable named *flash* and overwriting our *flash* *flash*. So the solution is simple, don't name the partial "flash" 

so change layouts to  

*app/views/layouts/application.html.haml*

~~~ruby
#...
    = render 'layouts/notice'
~~~

*app/views/layouts/admin.html.haml*

~~~ruby
#...
    = render 'layouts/notice'
~~~

and rename *_flash* partial to *_notice* partial

    mv app/views/layouts/_flash.html.haml app/views/layouts/_notice.html.haml













## PostgreSQL host problem in Linux Mint 13



 Working on one project using PostgreSQL and  evrything configured correctly, I kept on getting 

      rake db:migrate

      rake aborted!
      FATAL:  Peer authentication failed for user "postgres"


the reason was that defaultly instaled PostgeSQL on Mint 13 requirest to specify host. 
So quicksolution in my *database.yml* :


    development:
      adapter: postgresql
      encoding: unicode
      database: project_development
      pool: 5
      username: postgres
      password: secret
      host: localhost   #<<< solution 










##"fuzzystrmatch" module missing in Ubuntu and Mint 13

Working on one PostgreSQL porject I had an issue running *rake db:migrate* 

    PG::Error: ERROR:  could not open extension control file "/usr/share/postgresql/9.1/extension/fuzzystrmatch.control": No such file or directory
    : create extension fuzzystrmatch

solution 

    sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib 

than another error ocured:

    PG::Error: ERROR:  permission denied to create extension "fuzzystrmatch"
    HINT:  Must be superuser to create this extension.
    : create extension fuzzystrmatch

now this has nothing to do with "sudo" user so running *sudo rake db:migrate* won't help. The reason for this was that the fuzzystrmatch module for postgress requires database super user.

for me the solution was to just change the *database.yml* file to use deffault *postgres* super user

      development:
        adapter: postgresql
        encoding: unicode
        database: project_development
        username: postgres
        password: extrasafe
        host: localhost

but better solution will be ether in postgres config files garant usage of fuzzystrmatch module to regular users.













## rails hash that treets equally sybols and strings


     x = HashWithIndifferentAccess.new

example how to convert your regular hash to this kind of hash 

    ruby-1.9.2-p290 :060 > old_hash = { :nyu => "Elfen lied" } 
     => {:nyu=>"Elfen lied"} 
    ruby-1.9.2-p290 :061 > old_hash['nyu']
     => nil 
    ruby-1.9.2-p290 :062 > old_hash[:nyu]
     => "Elfen lied" 
     
     x = HashWithIndifferentAccess.new old_hash
     => {"nyu"=>"Elfen lied"} 
    ruby-1.9.2-p290 :066 > x[:nyu]
     => "Elfen lied" 
    ruby-1.9.2-p290 :067 > x['nyu']
     => "Elfen lied" 


ActionController parms are also this kind of hash :)

## force ssl in rails 


### on controller level 

in *app/controller/your_controller.rb*

     class LostPasswordsController < ApplicationController
  
       force_ssl
       # or...    force_ssl if Rails.env.production?
       

       def index

       end
     end 

if globally use it in application controller

### on route level 

In *config/routes.rb*

        MyApplication::Application.routes.draw do
          resources :sessions, :constraints => { :protocol => "https" }
        end


or for several of them 

        MyApplication::Application.routes.draw do
          scope :constraints => { :protocol => "https" } do 
            # All your SSL routes.
          end

## Bcrypt iplementation to Rails app

http://bcrypt-ruby.rubyforge.org/classes/BCrypt/Password.html

I was trying to iplement BCrypt encryption on one of tables and test that with rspec.


### way it should be done and works



~~~ruby
    it "should encrypt password before creation creation" do
      account = Bubla.new
      account.password = 'lorem' 

      account.save
      account.reload

      BCrypt::Password.new(account.password).should == 'lorem'
    end
~~~

~~~ruby
class Bubla < ActiveRecord::Base

# database table has column called password

  after_save :encrypt_password

  private
  def encrypt_password
    begin
      BCrypt::Password.new self.password  #will raise if non BCrypt string
    rescue BCrypt::Errors::InvalidHash
      self.update_attribute(:password, BCrypt::Password.create(self.password))
    end
  end

end
~~~




On [BCrypt site](http://bcrypt-ruby.rubyforge.org/classes/BCrypt/Password.html) there was really straingt forward example how to do that. Of course I did it different way that didn't work. My logic was to encrypt password before it's saved to database.


### way that will fail

~~~ruby
class Bubla < ActiveRecord::Base

  before_save :encrypt_password

  private
  def encrypt_password
    self.password =  BCrypt::Password.create(password)
  end

end
~~~

for some reason, in this scenarion rspec fails with 

       Failure/Error: BCrypt::Password.new(account.password).should == 'lorem'
       expected: "lorem"
            got: "$2a$10$HOaDPmirWXqeAzHGzGFm.u0P.GUcnLabnVZGcvXCSV6MPH8w5rzu6" (using ==)






another note: my colleague give me this link http://bcrypt-ruby.rubyforge.org/   ...there is another alternative how to do some parts, didn't get to it yet but you can check











## assets pipeline manifest files 


In smaller app it's good practice to have only one asset pipeline manifest file => *app/assets/stylesheet/application.css* , but in larger sites you might find out you need mero.

All you need is exact content as you have in *a/assetss/stylesheets/application.css* and copy it to your new one 

for example 

*app/assets/stylesheets/plain.css*

    *= require_self
    *= require other_file

Now you can link to it in your views.

*a/v/l/plain.html.haml*

    = stylesheet_link_tag "plain"


Because assets needs to be precompiled when running app, you need to add your new manifest file to list of environment manifest files 

*config/environment/production.rb*

     config.assets.precompile += %w( plain.css )
  

...else you get error like *plain.css isn't precompiled*  even if you run *rake assets:precompile*, once again do this even if you are precompiling assets locally 
Do this on all environments that are running on remote servers (staging f.e.)







## Checking user agent


In one of tasks given to me I had to check if the website is wisited by iOS native browser (not Safari, the browser that is lunched when you open website inside iOS application) and hide navigation bar. The reasoning was that from UX perspective, user is viewing the site from inside the application, so he shouldn't be able to go to home page. (f.e. if he is viewing terms and conditions) 

The reqirement was also that when viewing the website in iOS Safari, the navigation should be present. Because of this I couldn't use media queries nad just hide content if the device viewing the site has resolution les that 400px for example

The only solution left was detect user agent. 

so in my *app/assets/javascripts/detect_agent.js.coffee*

    if (navigator.userAgent.match(/CustomAgent/) != null)
      $('html').addClass('ios_app')   


and css sass file 

    html.ios_app
      .web_only
        display: none


but there was on issue that content loaded in native browser was "jumping", so we decided to fix it on server level 


in *a/c/application_controller.rb*

      def custom_user_agent?
        request.env["HTTP_USER_AGENT"] && request.env["HTTP_USER_AGENT"][/(CustomAgent)/]
      end
      helper_method :custom_user_agent?


in *a/v/layout/application.html.haml*

      %html{ :class=>"#{ 'lt_ios_app' if custom_user_agent? }"}



Note: the *CustomAgent* is custom agent variable that iOS application was overwriting in this app. By deffault the native iOS browser user agent is similar to Safari web browser user agent so is hard to detect it for 100% sure. So there is a way how to change the user agent in iOS   

solution from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8487581/uiwebview-ios5-changing-user-agent , in iOS:

    NSDictionary *dictionnary = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:@"Your user agent", @"UserAgent", nil];
    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] registerDefaults:dictionnary];  


## Facebook posts to wall without image
 
There are solutions to enforce facebook to display image once posted to fb wall http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1079599/facebook-post-link-image (just set the open graph meta tag image)
But what if you don't want facebook image? The thing is that facebook is trying to be clever and pull an  image for you from your web site.

the solution to do this is set the open graph image pointing to url of your website (don't point it to image, just website )

    <meta content='http://example.eu/' property='og:image'>   


Hovever, to make open graph meta tags working, you got to be sure that all required opet fcapd metatags are set correctly 

*  og:title - The title of the entity.
*  og:type - The type of entity. You must select a type from the list of Open Graph types.
*  og:image - The URL to an image that represents the entity. Images must be at least 50 pixels by 50 pixels. Square images work best, but you are allowed to use images up to three times as wide as they are tall.
*  og:url - The canonical, permanent URL of the page representing the entity. When you use Open Graph tags, the Like button posts a link to the og:url instead of the URL in the Like button code.
*  og:site_name - A human-readable name for your site, e.g., "IMDb".
*  fb:admins or fb:app_id - A comma-separated list of either the Facebook IDs of page administrators or a Facebook Platform application ID. At a minimum, include only your own Facebook ID.


exapmle meta tag data

    <meta content='' property='og:description'>
    <meta content='' property='og:image'>   
    <meta content='MyTest app' property='og:site_name'>
    <meta content='http://example.eu' property='og:url'>
    <meta content='website' property='og:type'>
    <meta content='10000123456789' property='fb:admins'>
    <meta content='Movies and music' property='og:title'>


The *og:image* tag cannot be blank or the [facebook linter page](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug) will complain 

    Object at URL 'http://example.eu/' of type 'website' is invalid because the given value '' for property 'og:image:url' could not be parsed as type 'url'.

to be honest when it comes to this particular problem, image wasn't displayed even if the image tag was blank, but it's not good practice.

## way to create custom time in future (or past( exact date 

Datetime with exact year

~~~ruby
DateTime.civil(5000)
#Wed, 01 Jan 5000 00:00:00 +0000 
~~~


~~~ruby
datetime = DateTime.civil(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, Rational(-6, 24)) 
#Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 -0600

in *config/enviroments/your_environment.rb* do

    YourApp::Application.config.web_hostname = 'bubla.mysite.com'

or better 

    YourApp::Application.configure do
      config.web_hostname = 'bubla.mysite.com'
    end
 

than access it in moddels 
   
    Rails.application.config.web_hostname 

Why ? 

it's much cleaner than seting constant in enviromests files

 *config/enviroments/your_environment.rb* 

      ENVIRONMENT_HOST_NAME= 'budla.mysite.com'   # it works but it's not pretty at all
