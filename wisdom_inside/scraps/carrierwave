Gemfile

~~~ruby
gem "rmagick"
gem "carrierwave"

bundle..


**note** to install Rmagick on ubuntu you have to do 

~~~bash
apt-get install libmagick9-dev
~~~


than you generate uploader 

~~~ruby
rails g uploader image
~~~


app/models/painting.rb

~~~ruby
class Painting < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :gallery_id, :name, :image, :remote_image_url
  belongs_to :gallery
  mount_uploader :image, ImageUploader
~~~



app/uploaders/avatar_uploader.rb

~~~ruby

  storage :file

  def store_dir
    "uploads/#{model.class.to_s.underscore}/#{mounted_as}/#{model.id}"
  end

  process :resize_to_limit => [1000, 1000]  #resize to limit is method inside Rmagick, carrierwave is just touching it 

  version :thumb do
    process :resize_to_limit => [200, 200]
  end
~~~


~~~ruby
rails g migration add_image_to_paintings image:string
~~~


~~~html
<%= image_tag painting.image_url(:thumb) if painting.image? %>
