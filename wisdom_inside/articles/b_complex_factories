Till recent I was using factories this way

~~~ruby
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :person, :class => Person do
    name 'Jhony'
  end
end


Factory.define do
  factory :main_category, :class => Category::Main do
    title => 'Main articles'
    association :some_other_association, :factory=> :some_other_factory
  end
end

Factory.define do
  factory :article, :class=> Articles do 
     title 'read me'
     association :person, :factory => :person
     association :category, :factory => :main_category
  end
end

~~~


So far so good, but when I dum part was how I call them inside complex Rspecs. They look like this: 

~~~ruby

@person = Factory.create :person
@category = Factory.create :main_category
@article = Factory.cerate :article, :person=>@person, :category

~~~

Long story short, if you don't want to repate same code over and ower again,  they should look something like this:












FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :cookie_platform, :class => CookiePlatform::Base do
    association :person, :factory => :person
    identifier '123'
    first_name Faker::Name.first_name 
    last_name Faker::Name.last_name
  end

  factory :authorized_cookie_platform, :parent => :cookie_platform do
    after_create do |platform|
      Factory(:authorization_cookie_platform, :person => platform.person, :platform=>platform)
    end
  end

end
