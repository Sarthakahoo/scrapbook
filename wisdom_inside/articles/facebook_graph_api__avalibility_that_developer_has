#investigation on facebook images 


*  image max size is 90x90
*  image can be small like 1px  and facebook will resize the post message
*  the optimum small image size is 10px for width (to be align with ico)

myths: 
*  if you post to facebook with caption " " (emty whitespace) image will be ignored
  *  this is a myth, maybe it will just won't download images from server but image provided with picture parameter will be displayed. Same thing for blank caption

What informations is  developer capable to catch from FB
=========================================================



If you  fetch informations with correct access token but there is no data, or the ID doesn't exist you won't get error message but empty Data array

        {
           "data": [
              
           ]
        }



#Publicly accessible informations #


Note: direct url depends what the id is, for instance https://graph.facebook.com/123 can be user but https://graph.facebook.com/1234 can be fan page, so more direct url id examples  are listed in [facebook api](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/) homepage. Also the id must be publicly accessible 

*  getting profile picture 
   *   https://graph.facebook.com/tomi.valent/picture
*  getting users album 
   *   https://graph.facebook.com/10150146071791729   (album id)











#Accessible informations  with access token from user #

Note: more informations we want to access,  longer the permission request is when user is confirming us permissions in dialog.

Summary
=======

  As developer there is possibility to fetch many informations from facebook user as long you have the permissions. We can fetch user statuses, family members, photo tags, likes, groups they belong to, events, notes,  posts, comments and responses (comments, likes) for them. We can also post on wall of an user, but not on his friends wall ( because we don't have auth. token for them). We can comment actual posts, and responses to those posts. 

There is possibility to create interface where we will be fetching comments from facebook and adding them to conversation on our site and even opposite way, sending to the wall post responses that people commented on our site. However this is not ideal because we can only post comment for those users whose auth. token we already have. Other people comments we must post as "service comments" = the person who will comment on FB will have the f.e. "site name"   not the real name of person whose token we don't have
