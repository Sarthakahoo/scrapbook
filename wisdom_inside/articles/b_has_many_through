We have 3 models 

~~~ruby

class Relationship
  belongs_to :person
end


class Person
  has_many :relationships
  belongs_to :admin
end

class Admin
  has_one :person
end
~~~

we can call 

    @person.relationships

but we wan't to be able to access relationships directly through admin object. Easiest way to do it through admin person instance

    @admin.person.relationships

but it would be cool to acces relationships just by calling 

    @admin.relationships

way to do do it is through **through**



~~~ruby
class Admin
  has_many :relationships, :through => person
  has_one :person
end
~~~



Options for :class_name, **:primary_key** and ** :foreign_key** are ignored, as the association uses the source reflection.
