What is new relic 
=================

[short video explaining what is new relic](http://newrelic.com/why-new-relic/how-it-works)

is a one place monitoring tool (scaling) for many languages (ruby java php python ...) suported for many providers (heroku ...) unlike [monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/) when som process dies (like delayed job), new relic wont start it automaticly but just sends an notification (this may be wrong, maybe gold program provides such a feature, but I didn' came accross it)

several possible programs
