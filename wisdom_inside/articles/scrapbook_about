Scrapbook is a new way of writing notes for your self. From my experience, developers and programers are writing their notes into database based wikies, blogs (private blagspot for ex.) or into word procesing editors like MS word or OpenOffice. (Been there, done it to)
The main reasons why I find this wrong are:









Want to run it bether localy ?
------------------------------

~~~bash
gem install shotgun
shotgun scrapbook.rb -p 3008
~~~



automatic start after login
---------------------------


In Ubuntu
System>Preferences>StartupApplications   
add
name: scrapbook 
command:
~~~bash
shotgun /home/tomi/rubyrubyruby/heroku/eq8scrapbook/scrapbook.rb -p 3008
~~~
(gem shotgun must be installed othervise just add *ruby /home/.../scrapbook.rb* )
requirements
============

(on Ubuntu,) Nokogiri gem used by this project will require some lib files. Install them:

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev

~~~

there shouldn't be any more dificulties
