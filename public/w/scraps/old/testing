h3. Testing emails

see: "email spec":https://github.com/bmabey/email-spec (mainly examples)
# @gem install email_spec --version '< 1.0.0'@
# @put @require 'email_spec'@  in @spec/spec_helper.rb@<br> or @config.gem "email_spec", :version => '< 1.0.0'@ in @enviroments/test.rb@ 

if you running rails 2 application and just do @gem install email_spec@, you will run into this error ??no such file to load -- rspec?? you have to instal gem version 0.6.4 ( "read why":https://github.com/bmabey/email-spec/issues#issue/25 )
??gem install email_spec --version '< 1.0.0'??


h3. Migrating test enviroment

If you have problem, that your test enviroment db is not updatede to current migration, try
??rake environment RAILS_ENV=test db:migrate??
