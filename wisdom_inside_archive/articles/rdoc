h1 generate rails doc

best way is to generate own doc rails app

??rails doc_project
cd doc_project
rake rails:freeze
rake doc:rails??

doc will apear in @doc_project/doc/api/@

or download it from "railsbrain":http://www.railsbrain.com/

"source of info":http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1202060/how-do-i-generate-rdoc-for-all-of-rails

note: this was writen to Rails 2.3 but will work to R 3 as well


h1 all gems rdoc

??gem server?? 

if you want rails to display in this @sudo gem install rails --rdoc@









h1 another way to get documentation

??gem unpack prawn
rdoc lib/??

.... and just open html documentation in that directory (doc)
BTW when you unpac prawn documentation this way, you will get lot of usefull examples in that directory
