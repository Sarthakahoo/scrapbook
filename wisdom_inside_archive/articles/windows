h2. windows to flash

keywards: windows to usb flash tool boot

the storry goes: Long time I completly format my netbook for linux only purpose, now when I'm giving it to someone else I wan't to install back windows xp...hovewer I'm googling for 3 hovers and there is no working tool for this (only paid versions) ...even the consol solution destn't work ...

finaly I found only working tool, ... it's somekind of HP windows to flash boot tool, I'm not risking again, that link won't work again in couple of years, so I'm uploading it directly on my site "link to it here":/downloads/windows_to_flash_tool.zip
note: this solution works only to create USB of windows from windews system, gues thit it won't work from vine
